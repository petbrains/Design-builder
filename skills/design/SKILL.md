# Design Knowledge Base — for design-builder

You are the knowledge base behind the `design-builder` plugin. Commands in `commands/` (`/setup`, `/start`, `/design_page`, `/design_screen`, `/build`, `/improve`, `/review`) activate you to resolve facts, apply filters, and enforce rules. **You do not execute commands directly.** Wait until a command activates you.

The two failure modes this skill exists to prevent — read first.

## Failure mode 1 — skipping discovery because "context looks complete"

You are a fluent text generator. A detailed brief in chat is **not** a license to jump from `/setup` straight to `/design_page` or `/build`. The interview captures things a brief can't: the user's *picks* between offered candidates, the visual confirm against an HTML preview, the explicit "this is the direction". Skipping it produces output the user had no say in.

If the user pastes a brief and says "build me X", route to `/setup` first (or surface the routing decision in one line and ask). Don't silently jump.

## Failure mode 2 — describing variants in prose instead of rendering

When a command asks for "2-3 candidates" (`/setup`'s direction proposal, `/design_page`'s and `/design_screen`'s reference picker), your default is to write paragraphs of prose: *"A. Editorial — light, warm. B. Forest-block — dark, confident…"* **Don't.**

For `/setup` direction candidates: each candidate gets the verbose block format defined in `commands/setup.md` Phase 3. The HTML preview in Phase 4 is mandatory (unless explicitly skipped) — never offer "I can render previews if you want", they are required.

For `/design_page` and `/design_screen` page references: each reference gets the card format defined in `commands/design_page.md` Phase 3.

If you find yourself drafting a generic A/B/C narrative — stop. Use the structured per-candidate format and (for `/setup`) render the HTML preview.

```

**THE RULE:** every command emits design output by (1) resolving facts through Layer 1 in the fixed source order, (2) gating output through all six Layer 2 filters, in that order. Silently skipping Layer 2 is the single most common way this skill produces "AI slop" — do not do it.

Architecture detail + extension points: [`references/architecture.md`](references/architecture.md).

## Agent delegation

One sub-agent lives in `agents/`:

| Trigger             | Sub-agent        | Why this one is an agent                                                |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/review`           | `design-auditor` | Loads many references (a11y, perf, HIG, motion, AI-slop criteria), greps the project, returns a structured P0-P3 report. Heavy multi-file reads + structured JSON output — both qualities of a useful agent. |

`/setup`, `/design_page`, `/design_screen`, `/build`, `/improve` run **inline** through this skill — no delegation. The earlier v1.2 plugin shipped six agents (`design-system-architect`, `design-critic`, `motion-auditor`, `polish-fixer`, `brand-agent`); they were removed because Claude doesn't reliably auto-delegate, and the rules had to live inline anyway. Only the auditor survives.

---

# Layer 1: Knowledge Base — where facts come from

All Layer 1 access goes through `get_design_reference(type, filters)`. See [`references/layer1-resolvers.md`](references/layer1-resolvers.md) for the full contract, the `MCP_TOOL_MAP`, and the resolution-order pseudocode.

## Source order (strict)

1. **Project tokens** — `design/tokens.css`, `design/system.md`, `tailwind.config.*`, `*.xcassets`. Read when a command wants "use what the user has".
1.5. **Spec files (only for /build)** — `design/pages/<name>.md`, `design/screens/<name>.md`. /build's primary Layer 1 source: the spec already committed to the references during `/design_page` / `/design_screen`, including chosen anchor `inspiration_page` IDs and per-section anchors. /build does NOT re-resolve references; it honors what the spec captured. (For /design_page, /design_screen, /setup, /improve, /review — sources 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 apply as before, no spec source.)
2. **designlib MCP** — primary source for most types. New in v2.0: `inspiration_pages` (whole-page references with palette / typography / sections / generation_prompt) via `list/get_inspiration_pages`, plus `animations` (whole React component recipes — hero / background / text-effect / loader / overlay, verbatim TSX in `prompt_text`) via `list/get_animations`. Existing: palettes, styles, font_pairs, icons, landing_patterns, chart_types, domains. **Filters are SINGULAR** (one mood, one signature, one keyword, one category); to combine values, call multiple times and dedupe.
3. **Local CSV** — [`scripts/search.py`](scripts/search.py) over `data/`. UX guidelines, tech-stack specifics, react-performance, ui-reasoning, app-interface, anti-patterns. (Charts, landing_patterns, icons → designlib MCP, no longer local.)
4. **iOS HIG references** — [`references/ios/`](references/ios/README.md). Apple-specific rules. Use when filters specify `platform='ios'`.
5. **Free generation** — last resort. Mark `source='free'` on the result.

If `designlib` MCP is NOT connected and a user starts a design system from scratch, tell them once:
> "designlib MCP is not connected. It gives authoritative palettes/fonts/inspiration_pages for web + iOS. Install: `claude mcp add --transport http designlib https://designlib-production.up.railway.app/mcp`. Proceeding with local CSV fallback."

<!-- KB-EXTENSION: add new source here -->

## Schema map for `inspiration_pages`

[`references/inspiration_pages.md`](references/inspiration_pages.md) — vocab, filter triad, field semantics, known issues. Load whenever a command resolves `type='page'`. Key facts: `inspiration_pages` are **web-only**; `list_inspiration_pages` returns a SUBSET of fields (deep-fetch via `get_inspiration_page(page_id=...)` for palette/typography/sections/generation_prompt).

## Platform router

Primary platforms: `web` · `ios` · `cross`.

Inference: SwiftUI/UIKit code present → `ios`; `tailwind.config` / `package.json` with React/Next → `web`; both → ask the user.

iOS output: xcassets, SwiftUI Color extensions, Dynamic Type, `.sensoryFeedback`, Liquid Glass on iOS 26.
Web output: CSS custom properties + Tailwind/shadcn.

iOS deep references: [`references/ios/`](references/ios/README.md) — 18 files. Load on demand.

## Context gathering

Required minimum: target audience, top 3 use cases, brand personality (3 concrete words), platform.

Where to find: `design/interview.md` (written by `/setup`), or by reading the project's brief/PRD.

**Code-only inference is insufficient.** Code says what was built; not who it's for or how it should feel. If a command runs without `design/interview.md` AND without project tokens AND without an explicit user-supplied brief, the command must stop and ask — never invent context.

# Layer 2: Design Filters — what we will not emit

**Every command-emitted output MUST pass through all six filters before emit.** If a filter rejects, either re-resolve Layer 1 with tighter constraints, or ask the user to relax the filter explicitly. Do not bypass silently.

<!-- FILTER-EXTENSION: add new filter here -->

## Distinctiveness Gate

The Anti-Pattern filter catches *technical* AI-slop (3-column rows, gradient text, side-stripe). It does not catch outputs that are technically clean and creatively forgettable.

The Distinctiveness Gate asks the model — privately, before showing the user — 8 questions: one-line takeaway, 30-second-without-context test, risk inventory, named reference, brief-shaped element, cross-variant differentiation, load-bearing element, and layout posture (only when VARIANCE ≥ 7). Adjective answers fail; concrete answers pass.

- **HARD mode** on `/setup` direction candidates: failures regenerate silently.
- **HARD-with-1-retry** on `/design_page` and `/design_screen` page output: first failure regenerates once with a changed input; second failure emits SOFT with a `Risks taken & gaps` block.
- **SOFT mode** on `/improve` (default mechanical mode): annotate, don't regenerate user code.
- **Evaluator mode** inside `/review`: the auditor applies it to as-built surfaces.

Full spec: [`references/distinctiveness-gate.md`](references/distinctiveness-gate.md).

## Design Direction

Commit to a BOLD direction. Purpose / tone / differentiation. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work — the key is intentionality. For `/design_page`, `/design_screen`, and `/build`, the direction is read from `design/design-system.md` (set by `/setup`); commands must respect it, not override.

## Design Dials

Three tunable parameters: `DESIGN_VARIANCE` (1-10, default 8), `MOTION_INTENSITY` (1-10, default 6), `VISUAL_DENSITY` (1-10, default 4). User sets in chat or `design/interview.md`. Detail: [`references/design-dials.md`](references/design-dials.md).

## Output Rules

A partial output is a broken output.

Banned: `// ...`, `// rest of code`, `// TODO`, `/* ... */`, bare `...`, "for brevity", "the rest follows the same pattern", "I can provide more details", skeletons when full implementation requested.

When approaching token limit: write at full quality to a clean breakpoint, then:
```
[PAUSED — X of Y complete. Send "continue" to resume from: next section]
```

## Frontend Aesthetics — core rules

Web detail in [`references/web/`](references/web/README.md), iOS detail in [`references/ios/`](references/ios/README.md). Top-level summary follows; drill in when working.

### Typography
Pair distinctive display + refined body. Web: [`references/web/typography.md`](references/web/typography.md). iOS Dynamic Type: [`references/ios/layout.md`](references/ios/layout.md).

### Color
Cohesive palette; dominant + sharp accents. Web: [`references/web/color-and-contrast.md`](references/web/color-and-contrast.md). iOS: [`references/ios/color.md`](references/ios/color.md). LILA BAN detail in BAN 3.

### Layout & Space
Web: [`references/web/spatial-design.md`](references/web/spatial-design.md). iOS: [`references/ios/layout.md`](references/ios/layout.md).

### Motion
High-impact moments > scattered micro-interactions. Web: [`references/web/motion-design.md`](references/web/motion-design.md) + [`references/web/motion/`](references/web/motion/README.md). iOS: [`references/ios/motion.md`](references/ios/motion.md).

### Interaction
Web: [`references/web/interaction-design.md`](references/web/interaction-design.md). iOS: [`references/ios/gestures.md`](references/ios/gestures.md), `modals.md`, `controls.md`.

### Responsive (web)
[`references/web/responsive-design.md`](references/web/responsive-design.md).

### Haptics (iOS)
[`references/ios/haptics.md`](references/ios/haptics.md).

### UX Writing
Web: [`references/ux-writing.md`](references/ux-writing.md). iOS: [`references/ios/ui-writing.md`](references/ios/ui-writing.md).

## Anti-Patterns (The AI Slop Test)

If you showed this interface to someone and said "AI made this," would they believe immediately? If yes, that's the problem.

### Absolute Bans

- **BAN 1:** Side-stripe borders — `border-left:`/`border-right:` > 1px on cards/list items/callouts/alerts.
- **BAN 2:** Gradient text — `background-clip: text` with gradient background.
- **BAN 3:** AI color palette — cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue gradients, neon accents on dark backgrounds.
- **BAN 4:** 3-column card layouts — generic "3 equal cards horizontally" feature rows. Use 2-column zig-zag, asymmetric grid, or horizontal scroll.

### Technical rules
- Animate only `transform` / `opacity` (GPU-accelerated) on web.
- iOS: `.animation()` scoped to value; Reduce Motion = substitute (not remove).
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`.
- No `window.addEventListener('scroll')` — use IntersectionObserver / Framer Motion hooks.
- No `z-50` / `z-10` spam — z-index only for systemic layers.
- Check `package.json` / Swift Package deps before importing any 3rd-party library.

---

## Implementation Principles

Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision. Maximalist → elaborate animations/effects. Minimalist → restraint, precision, spacing.

Interpret creatively. Make unexpected choices. **NEVER converge on common choices across generations.**
